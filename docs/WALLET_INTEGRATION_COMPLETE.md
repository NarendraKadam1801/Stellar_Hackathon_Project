# âœ… Freighter Wallet Integration - COMPLETE

## What Was Done

### 1. Installed Freighter API Package
```bash
npm install @stellar/freighter-api --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Updated Hooks

**`frontend/hooks/use-account.ts`**
- âœ… Now uses `isConnected()` and `getUserInfo()` from `@stellar/freighter-api`
- âœ… Properly fetches account information from Freighter
- âœ… Falls back to Redux state if Freighter doesn't have an account
- âœ… Returns proper account object with address and displayName

**`frontend/hooks/use-mounted.ts`** (NEW)
- âœ… Created useMounted hook for client-side rendering checks
- âœ… Prevents SSR hydration mismatches

### 3. Updated Connect Button

**`frontend/components/connect-button.tsx`**
- âœ… Now uses `setAllowed()` from `@stellar/freighter-api`
- âœ… Attempts Freighter connection first
- âœ… Falls back to wallet selector if Freighter fails
- âœ… Shows proper connection states

### 4. Updated Wallet Redux Slice

**`frontend/lib/redux/slices/wallet-slice.ts`**
- âœ… Uses `isConnected()` and `getUserInfo()` from Freighter API
- âœ… Proper connection flow with error handling
- âœ… Transaction signing uses `signTransaction()` from Freighter API
- âœ… Network passphrase set to "testnet"

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now

### Connect Wallet Flow:
```typescript
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet"
   â†“
2. setAllowed() is called from Freighter API
   â†“
3. Freighter extension opens and user approves
   â†“
4. getUserInfo() retrieves public key
   â†“
5. Redux state updated with public key and balance
   â†“
6. Wallet component displays connected state
```

### Sign Transaction Flow:
```typescript
1. User initiates donation
   â†“
2. Transaction XDR is created
   â†“
3. signTransaction() called from Freighter API
   â†“
4. Freighter extension opens for signing
   â†“
5. User signs transaction
   â†“
6. Signed XDR returned and submitted to blockchain
```
