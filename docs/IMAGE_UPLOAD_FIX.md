# Image Upload to IPFS - Fixed & Enhanced

## Changes Made

Fixed and enhanced the image upload functionality to ensure images are properly uploaded to IPFS and CID is returned correctly.

---

## Backend Fixes

### 1. IPFS Service Enhanced

**File:** `/server/src/services/ipfs(pinata)/ipfs.services.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Fixed file upload (removed incorrect `../public/` prefix)
- ✅ Changed from `pinata.upload.public.file()` to `pinata.upload.file()`
- ✅ Added file cleanup after upload
- ✅ Better error handling with specific messages

**Before:**
```typescript
const file = new File([fileBuffer], `../public/${data.originalname}`, { type: data.mimetype });
const uploadData = await pinata.upload.public.file(file);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const file = new File([fileBuffer], data.originalname, { type: data.mimetype });
const uploadData = await pinata.upload.file(file);

// Clean up local file after upload
fs.unlinkSync(data.path);
```

### 2. IPFS Controller Enhanced

**File:** `/server/src/controler/ipfs.controler.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added logging for debugging
- ✅ Ensured CID is returned in correct format
- ✅ Better error handling

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": {
    "cid": "QmXyz123...",
    "success": true
  },
  "message": "file uploaded",
  "success": true
}
```

---

## Complete Upload Flow

### 1. Frontend Upload

**File:** `/frontend/components/create-task-modal.tsx`

```typescript
// User selects image
<input type="file" onChange={handleImageChange} />

// On form submit
if (formData.image) {
  const uploadResponse = await apiService.uploadToIPFS(formData.image)
  if (uploadResponse.success) {
    imageCid = uploadResponse.data.cid
  }
}

// Create post with CID
const postData = {
  ...
  ImgCid: imageCid,  // "QmXyz123..." or "/placeholder.jpg"
}
```

### 2. API Service

**File:** `/frontend/lib/api-service.ts`

```typescript
async uploadToIPFS(file: File): Promise<ApiResponse<any>> {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);

  return this.request('/ipfs/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
  });
}
```

### 3. Backend Processing

**Flow:**
```
1. Multer receives file
   → Saves to ./public/[timestamp]-[filename]
   ↓
2. IPFS Controller
   → Validates file exists
   → Calls uploadOnIpfsBill()
   ↓
3. IPFS Service
   → Reads file buffer
   → Creates File object
   → Uploads to Pinata
   → Gets CID back
   → Cleans up local file
   ↓
4. Response
   → Returns CID to frontend
```

## Logging Output

### Successful Upload

**Backend Console:**
```
📤 File upload request received: task-image.jpg
📁 Reading file from: ./public/1730123456789-task-image.jpg
📊 File size: 245678 bytes
🚀 Uploading to Pinata...
✅ Pinata upload response: { cid: 'QmXyz123...', ... }
🗑️ Cleaned up local file
✅ File uploaded to IPFS successfully: QmXyz123...
```

**Frontend Console:**
```
Image uploaded to IPFS: QmXyz123...
```

### Failed Upload

**Backend Console:**
```
📤 File upload request received: task-image.jpg
📁 Reading file from: ./public/1730123456789-task-image.jpg
📊 File size: 245678 bytes
🚀 Uploading to Pinata...
❌ IPFS upload error: Network timeout
```

## File Upload Configuration

### Multer Settings

**File:** `/server/src/midelware/fileUpload.midelware.ts`

```typescript
// Allowed formats
const allowedFormats = ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif", "image/webp"];

// File size limit
limits: { fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 } // 10MB

// Storage location
destination: './public'

// Filename format
filename: `${timestamp}-${originalname}`
```

## API Endpoint

### POST /api/ipfs/upload

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/ipfs/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: [binary image data]
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": {
    "cid": "QmXyz123abc456def789...",
    "success": true
  },
  "message": "file uploaded",
  "success": true
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,

## Environment Variables

### Required for Pinata

```env
PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_token
PINATA_GATEWAY=your-gateway.mypinata.cloud
```

**Get from:** https://app.pinata.cloud/

## Testing

### Test 1: Upload Image via Frontend

1. Login as NGO
2. Click "Create New Task"
3. Fill in task details
4. Select an image file
5. Click "Create Task"
6. ✅ Check backend logs for upload progress
7. ✅ Check if CID is returned
8. ✅ Verify post has ImgCid in database

### Test 2: Upload via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ipfs/upload \
  -F "file=@/path/to/image.jpg"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": {
    "cid": "QmXyz123...",
    "success": true
  },
  "message": "file uploaded"
}
```

### Test 3: Verify on IPFS

```bash
# View uploaded image
https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXyz123...

# Or use your custom gateway
https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXyz123...
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Please provide img"

**Cause:** No file in request

**Solution:**
- Ensure form field name is "file"
- Check `enctype="multipart/form-data"` on form
- Verify file is selected before submit

### Issue 2: "Network timeout"

**Cause:** Pinata API unreachable

**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify PINATA_JWT is valid
- Try again after a moment

### Issue 3: "No CID returned from Pinata"

**Cause:** Pinata upload failed silently

**Solution:**
- Check Pinata account limits
- Verify JWT token has upload permissions
- Check file size is under limit

### Issue 4: Local file not cleaned up

**Cause:** File deletion failed

**Solution:**
- Check file permissions
- Verify ./public folder is writable
- Manual cleanup: `rm -rf ./public/*`

---

## File Cleanup

### Automatic Cleanup

Files are automatically deleted after successful upload:

```typescript
try {
  fs.unlinkSync(data.path);
  console.log("🗑️ Cleaned up local file");
} catch (cleanupError) {
  console.warn("⚠️ Failed to cleanup local file:", cleanupError);
}
```

### Manual Cleanup

If files accumulate in `./public`:

```bash
cd server
rm -rf ./public/*
```

---

## Security

### File Validation

1. **Type Check:** Only images allowed (jpeg, png, gif, webp)
2. **Size Limit:** Max 10MB
3. **Filename Sanitization:** Timestamp prefix added

### Best Practices

- ✅ Validate file type on frontend AND backend
- ✅ Limit file size
- ✅ Clean up temporary files
- ✅ Use secure Pinata JWT (don't expose in frontend)
- ✅ Validate CID format before storing

---

## Files Modified

1. **`/server/src/services/ipfs(pinata)/ipfs.services.ts`**
   - Added logging
   - Fixed file path
   - Changed to `pinata.upload.file()`
   - Added file cleanup

2. **`/server/src/controler/ipfs.controler.ts`**
   - Added logging
   - Ensured proper response format
   - Better error handling

- Incorrect file path (`../public/`)
- Using wrong Pinata method
- No file cleanup
- CID might not be returned properly

✅ **After:**
- Detailed logging at every step
